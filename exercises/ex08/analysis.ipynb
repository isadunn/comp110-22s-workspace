When brainstorming, try not to be critical of the ideas you come up with regarding scale, stakeholders impacted, or for any other reasons. In the markdown cell below, brainstorm 3 to 5 ideas you think would create value for you.\n",

    "\n",
    "In conclusion, students without prior experience find this couse much harder than students with any sort of experience. The average difficulty of having no exerience is 4.9, while the average of sone experience (anywhere from 2 months to 2 years) is only 3.6. In future work, it would be interesting to break this down further by each amount of experience rather than just some versus none as I did in my analysis. You could also compare prior experience level to pace and understanding to see if this gap is present in multiple areas of the course. Based on my personal experience and statistical analysis, I think there is evidence to support my idea for a slower introductory period within the course. While there would be less classes later in the course to cover certain material if the begining lessons were paced slower, I believe spending the time on the basics would benefit the students, the support staff, the academic intituion, and the societal work place at large much more than covering one period worth of further material. Students who have a better understanding of the basics will be better equipped to move forward in computer science.\n"
